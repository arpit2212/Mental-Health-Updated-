I'm here to listen without judgment if you'd like to talk about anything that's been on your mind.

Remember that it's perfectly okay to have good days and bad days - that's part of being human.

+ [*] (kill myself|end my life|commit suicide|take my life|don't want to live|want to die|ending it all) [*]
- I'm truly concerned about what you're expressing right now. These thoughts are serious, and you deserve immediate support. Please call a crisis hotline right away - in the US, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 988 or 1-800-273-8255. You can also text HOME to 741741 to reach the Crisis Text Line.

Please reach out to emergency services (911 in the US) or go to your nearest emergency room. Alternatively, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-8255 right away. They have trained counselors available 24/7 who know exactly how to help with what you're going through. Please make that call - your life is precious and irreplaceable.
- I need you to know that these thoughts are often symptoms of conditions that can be treated. Right now, the most important thing is your safety.

+ [*] suicide [*]
- Suicide is a very serious topic, and I want to address it with the care it deserves. If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, please know that immediate professional help is available. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (988 or 1-800-273-8255) provides 24/7 support. A trained mental health professional, like a psychiatrist or therapist, can provide proper assessment and care tailored to specific needs. Would you like to talk more about what's bringing this topic up for you today?
- I notice you've mentioned suicide, which is something I take very seriously. If you're having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out to emergency services (911 in the US) or a crisis hotline like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-8255 immediately. These thoughts are often symptoms of treatable mental health conditions, and speaking with a psychiatrist or therapist can help identify effective strategies for recovery. Is there something specific about this topic you'd like to discuss?
- Thank you for bringing up this important subject. Suicidal thoughts are medical emergencies that require professional intervention. If you're experiencing these thoughts, please contact a crisis service immediately - either call 988/1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741. Mental health professionals like psychiatrists and psychologists have specific training to help people through these difficult moments and can provide the treatment needed to help these thoughts subside. Would you feel comfortable sharing what prompted this conversation today?


+ [*] (harm myself|hurt myself|cutting|self harm|self-harm) [*]
- I'm concerned about what you're sharing regarding self-harm. These urges can be incredibly difficult to manage alone, and you deserve professional support. I strongly encourage you to speak with a mental health professional like a therapist or psychiatrist who can provide evidence-based treatments specifically for self-harm behaviors. In the meantime, some alternatives to consider include: holding ice in your hand, drawing on your skin with a red marker, vigorous exercise, or calling a crisis line like the Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) to talk through the urges until they pass.
- Self-harm is often a way of coping with intense emotional pain, and I want you to know that there are healthier alternatives that can provide relief. It's really important that you connect with a psychiatrist or therapist who specializes in this area - they can help identify triggers and develop personalized coping strategies. Some immediate alternatives to consider when urges arise include: snapping a rubber band on your wrist, screaming into or punching a pillow, taking a cold shower, or calling a supportive person. Most importantly, please know that you're not alone and recovery is absolutely possible with proper support.
- Thank you for trusting me with this. Self-harm behaviors are serious and indicate significant emotional distress that deserves professional attention. I strongly recommend speaking with a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide proper assessment and treatment. They might suggest approaches like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), which is very effective for developing healthier emotional regulation skills. While working with a professional, you might try distraction techniques when urges arise: intense physical activity, holding an ice cube, listening to music that matches your mood, or calling a crisis line for in-the-moment support.


+ [*] (eating disorder|anorexia|bulimia|binge eating|purging) [*]
- Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions that require specialized professional care. What you're experiencing is not your fault, and recovery is possible with proper treatment. I strongly encourage you to speak with both a psychiatrist and a registered dietitian who specializes in eating disorders. Early intervention significantly improves outcomes. Organizations like the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) offer resources and a helpline (1-800-931-2237) that can connect you with specialists in your area. Would you like to talk more about what you've been experiencing?
- I appreciate you sharing something so personal about your relationship with food and body image. Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions that typically require a team approach to treatment, including a psychiatrist, therapist, and nutritionist who specialize in this area. The recovery journey can be challenging but is absolutely possible with proper support. The NEDA helpline (1-800-931-2237) can provide resources specific to your situation. In the meantime, would it help to discuss some smaller steps you might take toward seeking help?
- Thank you for trusting me with this information about your eating behaviors. Eating disorders affect both physical and mental health and should be addressed by healthcare professionals with expertise in this area. A psychiatrist can help determine if medication might be helpful, while a therapist can work with you on the psychological aspects. Many people find that specialized treatment programs offer the comprehensive support needed for recovery. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to your doctor as a first step toward getting specialized help?


+ [*] (addict|addiction|alcoholic|alcoholism|substance abuse|drug problem) [*]
- Addiction is a medical condition that affects brain function and behavior, not a moral failing or lack of willpower. Recovery is absolutely possible with proper treatment. Speaking with a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction medicine can be an important first step - they can evaluate whether medication-assisted treatment might be helpful and recommend appropriate therapy approaches. Support groups like AA, NA, or SMART Recovery also provide community and accountability that many find essential for recovery. Would you like to talk more about what you've been experiencing?
- Thank you for sharing something so personal. Addiction treatment has come a long way, and we now know that a combination of medical treatment, therapy, and support works best for most people. A psychiatrist can provide a proper diagnosis and medication if appropriate, while therapists specializing in addiction can help address underlying causes and develop coping strategies. Professional treatment significantly increases chances of recovery. Would it help to discuss some options for finding specialists in your area?
- I appreciate your openness about addiction struggles. This is a health condition that responds well to proper treatment, and seeking help is a sign of strength. A psychiatrist or addiction medicine specialist can provide a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan that might include therapy, medication, support groups, and lifestyle changes. The SAMHSA helpline (1-800-662-4357) can provide referrals to local treatment facilities and information. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to a professional for an assessment of your specific situation?


+ [*] (panic attack|anxiety attack) [*]
- Panic attacks can be incredibly frightening, but they're not dangerous even though they can feel that way. When one occurs, try this grounding technique: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Deep, slow breathing is also crucial - try breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 1, and exhaling for 6 counts. If panic attacks are recurring, I strongly recommend seeing a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide proper treatment, which might include cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication that can be very effective.
- Panic attacks involve intense physical sensations caused by your body's fight-or-flight response activating when there's no actual danger. During an attack, focus on your breathing - place one hand on your chest and one on your stomach, and breathe slowly so that only the hand on your stomach moves. Remind yourself that the sensations will pass and you're not in danger. For recurring panic attacks, speaking with a psychiatrist or therapist is important - effective treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and sometimes medication can dramatically reduce or eliminate attacks.
- When experiencing a panic attack, remember that although the physical sensations are real and intense, they aren't dangerous and will pass. Try a technique called "box breathing": breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4, and repeat. Splash cold water on your face or place an ice pack on your chest to help activate your body's calming response. For long-term management, I strongly encourage consulting with a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide evidence-based treatments like CBT that are highly effective for panic disorder.


+ [*] (hear voices|seeing things|hallucinations|delusions|paranoid) [*]
- What you're describing could be symptoms that require immediate medical attention. Hallucinations and delusions can be caused by several different conditions, some of which respond very well to proper treatment. I strongly urge you to speak with a psychiatrist as soon as possible - they have the training to properly diagnose and treat these symptoms. If you're in distress or feeling unsafe, please consider going to an emergency room or urgent psychiatric care center for immediate help. Would you like to talk about options for getting professional help?
- I'm concerned about the symptoms you're describing, as they often require professional medical evaluation. A psychiatrist is the best person to assess these experiences, as they could be related to various conditions that need specific treatments. If these symptoms are causing distress or affecting your daily functioning, please consider it a medical priority to get evaluated. If you don't have a psychiatrist, your primary care doctor can provide a referral or you can contact your local mental health crisis team. How are you managing these experiences right now?
- Thank you for trusting me with this information. Experiences like hearing voices or having unusual beliefs that others don't share should be evaluated by a psychiatrist who can determine their cause and recommend appropriate treatment. Many people who experience these symptoms find significant relief with proper medical care. If these experiences are new or worsening, please consider it urgent to speak with a healthcare provider. Would it help to discuss some options for finding psychiatric care in your area?


+ [*] (trauma|ptsd|flashbacks|traumatic) [*]
- Trauma can have profound effects on our mental and physical health, but recovery is possible with appropriate care. Trauma-focused therapies like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy) have strong evidence for helping process traumatic experiences. Working with a psychiatrist or therapist who specializes in trauma can make a significant difference in healing. In the meantime, grounding techniques can help manage flashbacks: focus on your five senses, name things you can see/hear/feel, or hold something with a distinct texture or temperature. Would you like to talk more about your experiences?
- I'm sorry you've experienced trauma - those experiences can affect us in ways that can be confusing and distressing. When trauma symptoms like flashbacks or nightmares occur, it can help to remind yourself "I am safe now, this is a memory" and use sensory grounding techniques like holding something cold or focusing on deep breathing. For lasting healing, I strongly recommend working with a psychiatrist or therapist trained in trauma treatment. They can provide evidence-based approaches that have helped many people recover from similar experiences. How have you been coping with your trauma symptoms so far?
- Thank you for sharing something so personal about your trauma experiences. It's important to know that trauma responses are normal reactions to abnormal events - they're your brain's way of trying to protect you. While self-help strategies like mindfulness and grounding can help manage symptoms, working with a psychiatrist or trauma-informed therapist provides the most effective path to recovery. They can offer treatments specifically designed for trauma processing. Would it be helpful to discuss some options for finding trauma specialists or support resources?


+ [*] (depressed|depression) [*]
- Depression is a common but serious medical condition that affects how you feel, think, and act. It's not simply feeling sad, and it's not something you can just "snap out of" - it involves chemical changes in the brain that benefit from proper treatment. I strongly encourage you to speak with a psychiatrist or therapist, as treatments like therapy and medication have strong evidence for effectiveness. In the meantime, even small actions like brief daily walks, maintaining regular sleep hours, and staying connected with supportive people can help. Would you like to talk more about what you've been experiencing?
- Thank you for sharing how you're feeling. Depression can make everything feel more difficult and drain the joy from activities you once enjoyed. Professional help from a psychiatrist or therapist can make a significant difference - they can determine whether therapy, medication, or a combination would be most helpful for your specific situation. While working on getting professional support, try to be gentle with yourself and set very small, achievable goals each day. Would it help to discuss some strategies for managing depression symptoms while you seek professional care?
- I'm sorry you're experiencing depression - it can be an incredibly difficult and isolating experience. Please know that it's a medical condition, not a personal failing, and effective treatments are available. Speaking with a psychiatrist or therapist is an important step, as they can provide evidence-based treatments tailored to your needs. While professional help is essential, things like physical activity, sunlight exposure, social connection, and regular sleep patterns can complement treatment. How long have you been feeling this way, and have you considered professional support?

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


+ (ok|agree)
- I'm glad we're on the same page. How are you feeling about the conversation so far? Remember that talking about mental health can sometimes bring up different emotions, and that's completely natural. Is there anything specific you'd like to explore further?
- Thank you for your agreement. Opening up about mental health takes courage, and I appreciate your engagement in this conversation. Is there something specific about your mental wellbeing that you'd like to discuss further? I'm here to listen and provide support however I can.
- I appreciate your response. Conversations about mental health are important, and sometimes just acknowledging our feelings can be a positive step. Would you like to go deeper into any particular aspect of your mental wellbeing? Or perhaps you have questions about specific mental health strategies or resources?


+ [*] (be my friend)
- I'd be honored to be your friend and support you on your mental health journey. Having supportive connections is so important for our wellbeing. While I'm here to listen and provide guidance whenever you need it, I also encourage you to nurture real-world friendships that can provide the face-to-face connection we all need. How have your other social connections been lately? Is there anyone in your life you feel comfortable talking to about your mental health?
- I'm absolutely here for you as a supportive presence whenever you need someone to talk to. Friendship and social connection are vital for mental health, so I'm happy to be part of your support network. That said, I also hope you have people in your life who can provide in-person support. Would it be helpful to talk about strategies for building or strengthening your social connections outside of our conversations?
- I'd love to be a consistent, supportive presence for you. Everyone deserves to have someone they can turn to when they need to talk, and I'm happy to be that for you. At the same time, I want to make sure you have a diverse support network, as different types of relationships fulfill different needs. Would you like to discuss ways to nurture various types of connections in your life, from close friendships to casual acquaintances? All can contribute to mental wellbeing in different ways.


+ [*] (apologize|apology|sorry) [*]
- There's no need to apologize. Expressing and exploring your feelings is an important part of mental health, and this is a judgment-free space. Sometimes we feel we need to apologize for our emotions or struggles, but your feelings are valid and deserve to be acknowledged. Is there something specific that's making you feel like you need to apologize?
- Please don't worry about apologizing. Mental health journeys involve many emotions and expressions, and this space is meant for you to share freely without judgment. Many people find themselves apologizing for their feelings or struggles due to societal stigma around mental health, but here, there's no need. Your experiences and emotions are valid parts of being human. Would you like to talk more about what prompted that apology?
- No apology needed at all. This conversation is for you to express yourself authentically, without concern for how your thoughts or feelings might be perceived. Many of us have internalized the idea that we shouldn't burden others with our mental health challenges, but sharing and seeking support is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. I'm here to listen and support without judgment. What would feel most helpful to talk about right now?


+ (thank you|thanks)
